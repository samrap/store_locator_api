# Store Locator API

A RESTful API written in Rails that provides functionality for a store locator. Complete with CRUD functionality on both locations and business hours as well as full search functionality by current location (coordinates) and address.

**The main purpose of this project is to learn Ruby and Rails. It is a lighter-weight version of an API I wrote as a Laravel package at my current job.**

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement CRUD functionality for locations
- [ ] Implement CRUD functionality for business hours
- [ ] Implement all fields for locations
- [ ] Implement search by coordinates
- [ ] Implement search by address (will require integration with the Google Geocoding API)
